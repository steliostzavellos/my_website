# Introduction
The aim of the specific document is to analyse a dataset obtained from CDC, which spans over the 50 states in US, for the years 2008-2016, and contains firearm possession information and causes of death(suicide/homicide) of non-hispanic black and white males. By analysing the dataset we created a graph that describes the relationship between firearm homicide and suicide among white men along with reported gun ownership. The plot is referring to the journal article "Riddell_Annals_Hom-Sui-Disparities.pdf".

```{r fig.width=8}

data_set <- vroom(here::here("data", "CDC_Males.csv"))
# glimpse(data_set)

library(ggpubr)
# filter data set to get "Firearm" data
firearm_data <- data_set %>%
  filter(type=="Firearm") 
 
# plot suicide rate to homicide rate

replica <- ggplot(firearm_data, aes(x = adjusted.suicide.White, y = adjusted.homicide.White)) +  
  
  # color points by gun ownership and size by population
  geom_point(aes(fill = gun.house.prev.category, size = average.pop.white), col="black", pch=21)+  
  
  # add labels to graph to make it descriptive
  labs(title="Relation between Firearm Homicide and Suicide", subtitle = "For white men, along with reported gun ownership state-wise, years 2008-2016 (R: Spearman's rho)",
       x="White suicide rate (per 100,000 per year)", y = "White homicide rate (per 100,000 per year)") + 
  
  # using a black and white theme
  theme_bw()+

  # using a red color palette for the scatter points
  scale_fill_brewer(type='seq', palette='Reds')+

  # to prevent overlap of labels on the graph
  geom_text_repel(aes(label = ST), size = 3, min.segment.length = 1) +
  
  # used for scaling points and renaming for legend
  scale_size_area(breaks = c(500000, 1500000, 3000000, 7000000), labels = c("500k", "1.5m", "3m", "7m"), max_size = 20) +    
  
  # renaming legend titles and ordering
  guides(fill = guide_legend(title = "Gun ownership", order=1),size = guide_legend(title = "White population", order=2)) +    
 
  scale_x_continuous()+
  scale_y_continuous()+

  # calculating Spearman's correlation
