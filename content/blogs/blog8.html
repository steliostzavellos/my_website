<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The aim of the specific document is to analyse a dataset obtained from CDC, which spans over the 50 states in US, for the years 2008-2016, and contains firearm possession information and causes of death(suicide/homicide) of non-hispanic black and white males. By analysing the dataset we created a graph that describes the relationship between firearm homicide and suicide among white men along with reported gun ownership. The plot is referring to the journal article “Riddell_Annals_Hom-Sui-Disparities.pdf”.</p>
