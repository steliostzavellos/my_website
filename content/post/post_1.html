<h2>Background Info</h2>
<p>My name is <em>Stelios Tzavellos</em>, I was born and raised in Athens, Greece. Since a very young age I was always eager to explore the world and learn from different cultures, a mindset that has drove my decisions to study, work or visit different parts of the world.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Civil Engineering at the University of Bath in the UK, obtaining a first-class honours</p></li>
<li><p>Having my mind set in civil engineering, I pushed myself outside of my comfort zone of Europe, and completed in 2015-16 a one-year work experience, as a site engineer for the metro construction project in Doha, Qatar</p></li>
<li><p>The summer following the completion of my Bachelor’s degree in 2017, I completed an internship at the project management department of Hilalco (Wade Adams group) in Dubai and Abu Dhabi working for a large infrastructure project</p></li>
<li><p>I completed a Master’s degree in Transport Engineering at Imperial College London, from which I graduated in 2019 with the Maurice Hanson Prize, first in my class</p></li>
<li><p>In December and January 2018-2019 I worked at L.E.K. Consulting in London as an external contractor on a due-dilligence engagement, an experience which in conjunction with my degree at Imperial College convinced me to pursue strategy consulting as a career path</p></li>
<li><p>In February 2019, I returned to Greece to complete my military service obligation until December 2019</p></li>
<li><p>Upon completion of my service, I prepared my application for London Business School and gained work experience from the field of investment banking in Greece</p></li>
<li><p>Being currently a student at LBS reading for the Masters in Analytics with Management program, an unparalleled passport built from knowledge, skills and connections, I am ready to kick-start my career in the highly competitive market of the consulting sector</p></li>

<h2>Interests and Activities</h2>
<p>Having worked hard to achieve my academic and professional goals, I have learned to value my free time and enrich my life with activities that develop my personality.</p>
<p>Sports and especially football have been my passion since childhood, whilst during the summer months, Water-sports occupy a significant part of my free time, as I practice wake-boarding, windsurfing and scuba diving.</p>
<p>I also adore traveling, which I consider to be a unique way to get out of your comfort zone, broaden your horizons, explore and experience life. Being lucky enough to have traveled to more than twenty countries across 5 continents, I have developed multicultural awareness, language skills and a distinct real-life education.</p>
<p>Finally, I always aim to give back to society through volunteering activities. I have performed numerous environmental and social actions, however my most notable experience has been the one at the Kara Tepe refugee camp in Lesvos, Greece in 2016. I participated at a workshop organised by LATRA and UNHCR, where young designers and engineers from around the world spent a month hands-on redesigning, arranging and improving existing infrastructure of one of the largest refugee camps in Europe.</p>
<p>My ambition is to never stop learning about promising technologies, the way different sectors and organisations operate and explore the world as much as possible.</p>
